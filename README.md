# Quality of Inference (QoI) Consensus Protocol.

This repository was created with the aim of incorporeting a Collaborative and Decentralized structure in a Multi-agent DNN inference scenario. Two methods are presented: an Individualized Agent Decision Aggregation (IADA) method and a Quality of Inference (QoI) censensus protocol. 

Assuming that we operating in a multi-agent enviroment composed of $N$ agents, each one infer on its own 

# Master Thesis

This code was used to implement the experiments of my Master Thesis in Digital Media - Computational Intelligence of School of Informatics in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. 

# Datasets and Models.
We tested our proposed methods in two type of datasets. Synthetics and Real. The real datasets are: Cifar-10/ Cifar-100/ F-Mnist/ SVHN and Stl-10. The used models are: ResNet 18/52, VGG 10/16, MobileNet, RepVGG, ShuffleNet, DesNet and so on. 

# DNN Version testing.

```shell
python DNN_test.py

# Synthetic Version testing.

```shell
python Synth_Test.py
